#### Intro
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Computer Engineering.
<br>
I have previously been employed at Capital One and PhysIQ, as a software engineering intern. I have a passion for backend engineering, which has been the focus of my work, and "low-level", systems programming, which has been my focus at school. I am currently based in Champaign, but I'm only a phone call or email away!
<br><br>
#### Currently
I am currently the Web Director for our ECE conference, ECE Pulse, as well as a TA for Computer Systems Engineering, ECE 391. Between the two, I find myself juggling web development and systems engineering, which keeps things different and engaging from day to day, outside of classwork.
